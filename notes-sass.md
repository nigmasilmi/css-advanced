## 7-1 architecture

The 7-1 architecture is a common way to organize your Sass (SCSS) files in a structured and scalable manner. Here's a description of what each folder typically contains in the 7-1 architecture:

1. **base/**

   - Contains global styles, resets, and typography.
   - Files like `_reset.scss`, `_typography.scss`, `_colors.scss`, etc., would be placed here.

2. **components/**

   - Contains styles for reusable UI components.
   - Each component has its own folder with a Sass file containing component-specific styles.

3. **layout/**

   - Contains styles for the layout structure of your application.
   - Files like `_grid.scss`, `_header.scss`, `_footer.scss`, etc., would be placed here.

4. **pages/**

   - Contains page-specific styles.
   - Each page of your application can have its own folder with a Sass file containing styles specific to that page.

5. **themes/**

   - Contains styles related to theming or different visual variations of your application.
   - Files like `_dark-theme.scss`, `_light-theme.scss`, etc., would be placed here.

6. **abstracts/**

   - Contains Sass utilities, mixins, functions, and variables.
   - Files like `_variables.scss`, `_mixins.scss`, `_functions.scss`, etc., would be placed here.

7. **vendors/**

   - Contains third-party or external styles, such as CSS frameworks or libraries.
   - Files like `_bootstrap.scss`, `_font-awesome.scss`, etc., would be placed here.

8. **main.scss**
   - The main entry point for your Sass styles.
   - This file typically imports all other Sass files and acts as the compiled output for your entire stylesheet.

This architecture helps maintain a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to manage and scale your stylesheets in large projects. Each folder has a specific purpose, making it easier to find and update styles as needed.
